# Windows-Server-2019-deployment-project
This project focuses on deploying a Windows Server 2019 environment using Oracleâ€™s VirtualBox virtualization platform. The objective was to simulate a virtualized IT infrastructure for testing, configuration, and learning purposes, specifically within a networked lab environment.

Key steps included:

Installation and Configuration: Windows Server 2019 was installed from ISO, with VirtualBox providing the virtual environment.
Active Directory Setup: Configured Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), enabling centralized user management, group policies, and authentication.
DNS & DHCP Services: Deployed and configured DNS and DHCP services to manage and automate IP address distribution and domain name resolution within the virtual network.
User Management & Group Policies: Set up multiple users and configured group policies to enforce security and administrative controls.
Firewall and Security Settings: Applied security baselines, including Windows Defender Firewall and specific role-based access controls to safeguard the server environment.
